# LOD Expressions

* The Level of Detail (LOD) expression is a feature in Tableau that helps you to add multiple levels of granularity to your visualisations.
* There are three types of LOD expressions: Include, Fixed and Exclude.

## INCLUDE

An Include LOD ‘includes’ a dimension in its calculation even if it is not present in the visualisation.

## FIXED

A Fixed LOD does not include any additional dimensions in its calculation

## EXCLUDE

An Exclude LOD ‘excludes’ any dimensions from its calculation.
