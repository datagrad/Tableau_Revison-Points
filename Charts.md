# Types of Charts

### Bar charts
* Bar charts are used for comparing data values or tracing changes in data over a period of time.
### Line charts
* Line charts are used for analysing data values over a period of time.
### Area charts
* An area chart is a line chart where the area between the line and the axis is shaded with a certain colour.
* These charts are used for representing the accumulated total values over a period of time and are the conventional way of displaying stacked lines.
### Box plots
* Box plots are quite effective when you want to compare the distribution of two quantitative variables.
* The constituents of a box plot are as follows:
    * The line inside the box denotes the median value, and 50% of the data lies both above and below that value.
    * The boundaries of the box denote the 25th and the 75th percentiles.
    * The whiskers denote the lowest and the highest values in the data set (excluding outliers).
    * Any observations lying below or above the whiskers are considered to be outliers.
    * Outliers are the data points that have absurdly high or low values than those of the other observations.

### Maps
* Maps is an online functionality provided in Tableau.
* To build a simple map, data source must contain location data (location names, or latitude and longitude coordinates). The map which contains points in each state, for example, is called a point map.
* The map which contains states filled with varying colour, for example, is called a filled map or a polygon map.

 

### Hierarchies
* A hierarchy of features, such as country, state and city, can be created to obtain richer visualisations using the same data set.

 

### Pie Charts
* Pie charts are effective tools for visualising a particular category as a ratio of the total available categories.

 

### Treemaps
* Treemaps plot the quantitative variables for each category of the dimension.
* The values of the quantitative variables are represented by the size and the colour intensity of the plot.
* They can only accommodate two measures: one to control the size and the other to control the colour. 
* However, it can accommodate any number of dimensions, as it would only increase the number of rectangles on the treemap.
