# Types of Charts

### Bar charts: Bar charts are used for comparing data values or tracing changes in data over a period of time.
### Line charts and filters: Line charts are used for analysing data values over a period of time.
### Area charts: An area chart is a line chart where the area between the line and the axis is shaded with a certain colour. Typically, these charts are used for representing the accumulated total values over a period of time and are the conventional way of displaying stacked lines.
### Box plots: Box plots are quite effective when you want to compare the distribution of two quantitative variables. The constituents of a box plot are as follows:

The line inside the box denotes the median value, and 50% of the data lies both above and below that value.
The boundaries of the box denote the 25th and the 75th percentiles.
The whiskers denote the lowest and the highest values in the data set (excluding outliers).
Any observations lying below or above the whiskers are considered to be outliers. Outliers are the data points that have absurdly high or low values than those of the other observations.

### Maps: 'Maps' is an online functionality provided in Tableau. To build a simple map, your data source must contain location data (location names, or latitude and longitude coordinates). The map which contains points in each state, for example, is called a point map. The map which contains states filled with varying colour, for example, is called a filled map or a polygon map.

 

### Hierarchies: A hierarchy of features, such country, state and city, can be created to obtain richer visualisations using the same data set.

 

### Pie Charts: Pie charts are effective tools for visualising a particular category as a ratio of the total available categories.

 

### Treemaps: Treemaps plot the quantitative variables for each category of the dimension.
The values of the quantitative variables are represented by the size and the colour intensity of the plot. They can only accommodate two measures: one to control the size and the other to control the colour. However, it can accommodate any number of dimensions, as it would only increase the number of rectangles on the treemap.
